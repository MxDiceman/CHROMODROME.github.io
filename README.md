Wiki for use in playing CHROMODROME, a tabletop RPG set in the dark future of the Texaplex

CHROMODROME is a pet project that has been in development since Late 2016, but this latest re-make began in Spring of 2018. It's a heart break game, by me and for my tabletop group. If you've found this, I hope that you also enjoy it. If you've enjoyed it, I hope you play it with your friends.

Thanks Kimosabe,
